# spaghetti-code üçù

- **Idea**: Private-sessioned code battles (with Video/Audio chat)
  - First player writes the code, second player guesses the output
  - Both players attempt to solve the challenge as quick as possible
  - Both players attempt to solve the challenge in smallest code size

---

- **Conflict Plan**
  - In the case of conflict, the group will resort to voting.

- **What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**
  - We'll start with the easiest features, and add more features as time allows. 

- **Communication Protocol**
  - Verbalize your idea in the **Slack** channel before adding it in your branch, and check everyone's opinion on it
  - This allows all members to be updated on all currently worked-on features

- **Git Process**
  - Each member will work on their branch
  - Merging works best in a group session meeting
  - Make a branch called `dev`, which will act as a temporary `main`
  - All merging should happen to `dev`, which only merges to `main` when something is viable and tested

- **How often will you merge?**
  - Try as much as we can to merge every night 

- **How will you communicate that it‚Äôs time to merge?**
  - Through metaphysical telepathy
